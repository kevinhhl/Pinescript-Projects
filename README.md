A repository containing open source projects that I put out on Tradingview's platform. 

Goal is to use simple quantitative methods to systematically replicate the process of technical analysis (TA). Ironically, this process has made me accept the notion that price is random. In every TA strategy I’ve coded and tried backtesting with, I often see underperformance against market returns yielded by the underlying instrument had either long/short been taken and held during the time horizon of backtested period. I jump to conclude that short term trading (or the corrupted term called “daytrading”) should only be done if one is (a) restricted from holding overnight positions, and (b) employs capital provided by a third parties, or is levered in a way that still enables buffer for temporarily drawdowns. 

In my opinion, the application TA is no better than the flip of a coin, but the goal is to do it in the right time during interpreted euphoric moments. TA is essentially a form of tea leaf reading / horoscope reading (sarcasm intended, but also serious as well). But this should not deter one from spending time writing scripts to dabble around it (and I empathize that it should be “around” it, not “in” it). It’s still a fun exercise, similar to doing crossword puzzles. At the end of the day, one must still establish a systematic approach to deciding when to enter/exit as opposed to doing it based on mood swings. PineScript happens to be a great tool because runtime takes place in TradingView’s servers.
