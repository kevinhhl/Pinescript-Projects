A repository containing open source projects that I put out on Tradingview's platform. Goal is to use simple quantitative methods to systematically replicate the process of "technical analysis" (which is essentially a form of tea leaf reading, and horoscope reading [sarcasm]). Link to the rest of my projects at http://tradingview.kevinhhl.com
